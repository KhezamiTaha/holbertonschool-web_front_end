![javaScript](./Closures-In-JavaScript-Calibraint-1024x465.webp)

An advanced JavaScript project from Holberton School focused on mastering **closures**, **lexical scoping**, **execution stack**, **callbacks**, **DOM manipulation**, and **function binding**. This project is a deep dive into powerful JavaScript concepts using only **vanilla JS**.

---

## 📝 Description

This repository contains multiple scripts that demonstrate core advanced JavaScript principles. Each task builds upon the previous one to reinforce real-world application of closures, binding, callback functions, and more.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand lexical scoping in JavaScript
- Create and chain closures effectively
- Simulate private methods using closures
- Master JavaScript's execution stack
- Implement and use function binding
- Apply callbacks in asynchronous code
- Manipulate the DOM with closures

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Editor**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- All files end with a **new line**
- File extension: `.js`
- A `README.md` file at the root is mandatory
